<h3>About This Product</h3><hr />

<ul>
<li><h3>Rope Sewn Ties</h3><p>All our banners include rope sewn ties. The term “rope sewn” means that the rope is “captured” inside the hem prohibiting it from having a draw string effect. A banner hem that doesn’t “capture” the rope frequently allows the banner to “creep” toward its center and makes the banner difficult to read. It’s always a good idea to use the “rope sewn ties” as the primary form of anchoring for your banner.</p></li>

<li><h3>6-Color Process Inkjet Technology</h3><p>Our printing process employs both 6 color and 8 color process printing equipment. Process printing is an excellent banner printing solution, allowing printers to produce vivid full color and simulated spot color images very efficiently. In our case, we accomplish this by printing direct to the substrate without the need for plates or screens much like you might print a color document on a home color printer but with much larger and far more complex equipment.</p></li>

<li><h3>Heavy Duty Polyester Reinforced Vinyl (PRV)</h3><p>PRV is used in many industrial and structural applications such as commercial tents and awnings. It makes an ideal banner material because it is strong, flexible and outdoor durable. It is also available in rolls up to 16’ wide unlike many other materials. While there are many substrates that may be used for banner fabrication PRV is among the most popular.</p></li>

<li><h3>Double Needle Lock Stitch</h3><p>We use double needle lock stitching on all our banners. It is a very cost effective and positive way to finish a banner. We’ve never had a banner returned for stitches failing. Never!</p></li>

<li><h3>No Grommets</h3><p> Banner sizes under 4' x 15' do not feature grommets. If you want grommets installed in a banner smaller than 4' x 15' please feel free to call in and we will give you a quote. Otherwise, banners 4' x 15' and larger include grommets featuring two grommets every 5'.</p></li>

<li><h3>Non-Collapsible Interlocking 13' Pole</h3><p>The Feather Dancer pole does not telescope, it “stacks”. In other words one section plugs into the next. Telescoping poles are known to arbitrarily collapse paralyzing your advertising campaign. Our proven pole design is reliable and will not collapse.</p></li>

<li><h3>Aquajet Printing Process</h3><p>Feather Dancers are printed with a “Green” printing process that utilizes a specially formulated water based dye set. Our dyes are both fade resistant and bleed resistant. While the dye set is outdoor durable, please remember, there is no “forever”flag. Outdoor flags are subjected to a great deal of stress from wind, rain and sun and therefore deteriorate more quickly than hard signage.</p></li>

<li><h3>3.8 oz. Polyester</h3><p>Printed Feather Dancer flags are made of special 3.8 oz. knitted polyester flag fabric that is specially pre-treated in order be receptive the unique water based dye set that our printing process employs.</p></li>
